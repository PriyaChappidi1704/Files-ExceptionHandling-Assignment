        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime, making debugging easier. Compiled languages convert code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance. Python is an interpreted language.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling allows a program to respond to runtime errors gracefully using try, except, finally, and else blocks. It helps in preventing crashes and debugging errors effectively.\n",
        "3.  What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used to release resources like file handles or database connections.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Logging is the process of recording events or messages from a program. It helps in monitoring, debugging, and tracking the behavior of the application using the logging module.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the _ _del_ _ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The _ _del_ _ method is a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to perform cleanup operations like closing files or releasing memory.\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - import module imports the entire module, requiring prefixing with module name. \"from module import item\" imports specific functions/classes, allowing direct usage without module prefix.\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - Python allows multiple except blocks for different exception types. Alternatively, multiple exceptions can be handled in a single block using tuples.\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically closing the file after its suite finishes, ensuring proper resource management.\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multithreading involves multiple threads in a single process, sharing memory. Multiprocessing uses separate processes with independent memory, suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - Logging helps track application events, aids debugging, and maintains a record of issues. It improves code maintainability and monitoring.\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Python handles memory automatically using reference counting and garbage collection. It efficiently manages object lifecycles and deallocates unused memory.\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Wrap risky code in a try block, handle exceptions in except, optionally use else for no-error cases, and finally for cleanup tasks.\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Proper memory management prevents memory leaks, optimizes performance, and ensures efficient resource utilization.\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  - try block contains code that might raise an error, while except defines how to handle specific exceptions without crashing the program.\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  - Python uses automatic garbage collection through reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to reclaim unused memory.\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The else block runs if no exception occurs in the try block. It's used to separate error-handling code from normal execution.\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  - Python supports DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL logging levels, helping classify the importance of logged events.\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "  - os.fork() creates a child process (Unix-only), whereas multiprocessing is cross-platform and offers a higher-level interface to manage processes.\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - Closing a file releases system resources and ensures all data is properly saved. It also prevents file corruption and resource leaks.\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  - file.read() reads the entire file content as a string, while file.readline() reads only one line at a time.\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  - The logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from programs and supports multiple logging levels and outputs.\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "  - The os module enables interaction with the operating system, allowing operations like file creation, deletion, path navigation, and directory management.\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Issues like memory leaks, circular references, and managing large datasets pose challenges. Python's garbage collector mitigates but doesn't eliminate them.\n",
        "24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "  - Exceptions can be manually raised using the raise statement. For example: raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\").\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - Multithreading improves application performance in I/O-bound tasks by running multiple operations concurrently, enhancing responsiveness.\n"
